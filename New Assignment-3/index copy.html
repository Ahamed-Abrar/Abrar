            <p><em>What should come <span class="important-text">first, houses or museums?</span> </em></p>
            <p>Everything at once: the houses, the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban Planning cannot ignore <span class="important-text">cultural issues</span>. If in the construction of new <span class="important-text">neighbourhoods </span>, new housing forms the basis of the city plan (and by housing we also mean the market, the schools and the public services like the hospital and the post offices), the <span class="important-text"> planning </span>of a city cannot overlook two key public buildings that still today are considered an <span class="important-text"> intellectual luxury: the Museum and the Library</span>.</p>
  
           <p><em>Museum? What is a museum?</em></p>
  
           <p>In everyday life, when we want to describe a person, thing or idea that is <span class="important-text">outdated </span>, not practical or useful, we often say <span class="important-text">‘they belong in a museum’</span>. The expression is a clear indicator of the place <span class="important-text">museums</span> occupy in <span class="important-text">contemporary culture</span> , the perception of them as <span class="important-text"></span>dusty, useless spaces</Span>. Sometimes museums are merely the <span class="important-text">stage</span> for the exhibitionist <span class="important-text">antics of architects</span> who, rather than designing them to showcase the ‘pieces’, create complex confections with a <span class="important-text">decorative character</span> that gets in the way of the ‘museology’. On other occasions, the museum is the<span class="important-text">setting for dilettantes</span>, for ladies who lunch looking for something to <span class="important-text">fill in the time</span>, who dabble in sculpture, painting or ceramics and exhibit their handicraft in ‘museums’ that generally <span class="important-text">lack </span>the one thing that ought to be there: namely, a <span class="important-text">real collection</span> of painting and sculpture. The <span class="important-text">modern museum</span> has to be a <span class="important-text">didactic museum</span>, able to <span class="important-text">marry conservation </span> with the message that it is the <span class="important-text">art that must be highlighted</span>, while <span class="important-text">everything else</span> has a far <span class="important-text">more modest</span> role. This has to be clearly understood by the architect, who should never use the commission as an opportunity for self-aggrandising pyrotechnics such as you find, for example, at the Castello Sforzesco, where Michelangelo’s celebrated Pietà has been encased in a kind of monument that almost immediately acquired some less than respectful nicknames, or like it happened at the exhibition of the Beistegui Collection at the Louvre in Paris, which was displayed against a series of walls draped in red velvet and gold better suited for a jockey club than to a museum.</p>
  
           <p>The problem of the museum has to be <span class="important-text">tackled</span> today on <span class="important-text">‘didactic’ and ‘technical’ grounds</span>. These foundations are essential if the museum is not to become petrified, that is, entirely useless.</p>
  
            <p>The experience gained in this field with the <span class="important-text">São Paulo Museum of Art </span>can be of <span class="important-text">great use</span> here. After all, what is the point of an <span class="important-text">isolated work of art</span>, even if it’s exhibited with the most perfect museological technique, if it remains ‘an end in itself’, with no connection at all to our times, with no historical continuity? The visitors, especially the <span class="important-text">younger ones</span>, will look at the objects in a <span class="important-text">superficial way</span>, without understanding their meaning, their historical lessons, the light they can shed on the present. <span class="important-text">Baroque sculptures</span>, saints, silverware, tiles, paintings, altarpieces - all will be <span class="important-text">mere artistic curiosities</span> to the visitor. In real terms, 
            what didactic methods should we use? Evidently written texts, brief and succinct, and <span class="important-text">not in the language of the PhD</span>, accompanied by photographs – in a sort of cinematographic commentary. It is only by satisfying these didactic needs that the museum will be able to occupy a vital place and be worthy in the <span class="important-text">gradation of human needs</span> demanding prompt solution, and of being built at the <span class="important-text">same time as the houses</span>.</p>
  
            <p>These considerations are of the utmost <span class="important-text">importance as Bahia</span> stands on the brink of creating what could well one day become - given the importance of its collection and the <span class="important-text">beauty</span> and poetic fascination of the building that will be its home - the country’s most important museum: the <span class="important-text">Santa Teresa Museum of Sacred Art</span>.</p>
  
            <p>A museum that ought to have its <span class="important-text">own didactic voice</span> in order to become a ‘true’ museum, which is <span class="important-text">‘alive’</span>, and <span class="important-text">not</span> a ‘museum’ in the most <span class="important-text">obsolete</span> use of the term.</p>
